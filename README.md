# Agent Supervisor Demo (LangGraph)

This project is a hands-on demo of multi-agent orchestration using LangGraph
.
It shows how a Supervisor Agent can coordinate multiple Worker Agents (e.g., research, math) to solve complex tasks step by step.

ðŸ”Ž Whatâ€™s inside

Supervisor Agent â€“ decides which worker should handle each request.

Research Agent â€“ uses the Tavily web search tool to gather information.

Math Agent â€“ performs simple calculations (add, multiply, divide).

LangGraph â€“ connects everything in a state graph.


ðŸ’¡ Example usage

Ask a question that mixes research + math:

Using recent sources, what's New York state's share of US GDP? 
Then multiply that share by 100.


The Supervisor Agent will:

Send the research part to the Research Agent.

Forward the math part to the Math Agent.

Return the final result.

## Setup
```bash
