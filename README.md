# Agent Supervisor Demo (LangGraph)

This project is a hands-on demo of multi-agent orchestration using LangGraph
.
It shows how a Supervisor Agent can coordinate multiple Worker Agents (e.g., research, math) to solve complex tasks step by step.

ðŸ”Ž Whatâ€™s inside

Supervisor Agent â€“ decides which worker should handle each request.

Research Agent â€“ uses the Tavily web search tool to gather information.

Math Agent â€“ performs simple calculations (add, multiply, divide).

LangGraph â€“ connects everything in a state graph.

## Setup
